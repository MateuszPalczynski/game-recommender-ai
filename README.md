# Board Game Group Analyzer & Recommender

## Summary

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of board games, leveraging machine learning to automatically group them into distinct clusters and generate human-readable descriptions for each group. The core of the project is an unsupervised clustering pipeline using **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, followed by a unique method for automated group characterization using **Decision Trees**.

The main goal was to create a robust clustering system and then use a "white-box" machine learning model to automatically generate descriptions based on the labels provided by the clustering algorithm. The project culminates in a user-friendly web application built with **Flask**, which allows users to explore these game groups, get recommendations for similar games using a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** model, and view top-ranked games within each category.

## Key Features

- **Automated Game Clustering**: Utilizes Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), an advanced algorithm that generalizes K-Means, to partition games into 38 distinct groups based on their features.
- **Automatic Group Description**: A novel approach where a Decision Tree model is trained on the cluster labels to generate interpretable, human-readable rules that characterize each group.
- **Adjustable Description Length**: The web app allows users to choose between short and long descriptions, a feature directly implemented by controlling the `max_depth` of the Decision Trees.
- **Similar Game Recommendations**: A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model finds the 5 most similar games to a selected title based on their feature-space distance, providing fine-grained recommendations.
- **Top-Ranked Game Lists**: For each group, the application displays the top 10 games sorted by their BGG Rank.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A simple and intuitive frontend built with Flask allows users to easily search for games and explore the results.

## Project Methodology

The project pipeline is divided into several key stages:

### 1. Data Analysis and Preparation
The initial phase involved cleaning, analyzing, and preparing the board game data. Features were processed and prepared for use in unsupervised learning models.

### 2. Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
For the core task of grouping games, Gaussian Mixture Models were chosen. GMM, an implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, is a powerful probabilistic model that can identify more complex, non-spherical clusters compared to K-Means. The process included hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal number of clusters and model configuration.

### 3. Automated Description with Decision Trees
This was the central innovation of the project. To understand *why* a game belongs to a certain cluster, we treat the cluster labels generated by GMM as ground truth. A **Decision Tree**, a "white-box" model, is then trained to predict a game's cluster based on its features. Because the tree's structure is a series of explicit `if-then` rules, we can automatically parse these rules and convert them into human-readable text, effectively creating a description for each cluster.

### 4. Rationale for Algorithm Choice
Alternative clustering algorithms like **HDBSCAN** and **Agglomerative Clustering** were considered but ultimately not used. Their built-in hierarchical structure, while useful for some tasks, did not align with the project's goal of using an external white-box model to generate descriptions for flat, distinct clusters.

### 5. Similarity Analysis with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
To complement the high-level group analysis from GMM, a k-NN model was implemented. It operates on the same feature space to find the 5 individual games that are "closest" (most similar) to any selected game, providing specific "if you like this, try that" recommendations.
